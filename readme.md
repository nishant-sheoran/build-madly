This repository documents the hands-on assignments and projects undertaken as part of the **Modern Application Development I (BSCS2003)** course in the [IIT Madras Online B.S. Degree in Data Science and Applications](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSCS2003.html).

## 📘 Course Overview

**Modern Application Development I (BSCCS2003)** is a 4-credit course that introduces learners to foundational concepts and practices in web application development. It focuses heavily on a practical, project-based approach where learners apply what they learn each week through structured assignments.

## 📃 Key Learnings

Throughout the course, I've gained experience with:

* Structuring webpages using **HTML5** with semantic and layout tags
* Creating multi-page websites and linking them effectively
* Following strict HTML tag usage constraints to encourage clean code
* Designing simple user interfaces without CSS or JavaScript in early assignments
* Preparing for more advanced topics including **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Flask**, and **MySQL**
* Understanding the importance of readable, maintainable, and standards-compliant code

These assignments offer a solid foundation for building modern web applications.

Each folder inside `build-madly/` corresponds to a weekly assignment and contains all related submission files.

## 📄 Assignment Snapshots

### Week 2: HTML Only Assignment

* Created a five-page static website with strict HTML-only constraints
* Utilized headers, footers, internal links, images, and a downloadable resume
* Adhered to defined tag usage rules (e.g., limited number of `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`, etc.)

Future assignments will cover styling with CSS, client-side interactivity using JavaScript, server-side development with Flask, and deploying web apps with integrated databases.
